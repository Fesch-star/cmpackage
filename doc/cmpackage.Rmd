## Introduction
cmpackage is used to conduct analyses of cognitive mapping network data. A cognitive
map is a network graph which displays all causal and utility relations that were derived
from a text or displays the causal and normative beliefs of actors derive directly
from respondents (via a survey, interview or focus groups).

One of the main analysis one can do is to derive which concepts are deemed most
important (has the highest salience) in the cognitive map.

```{r}

node_calc <- calc_degrees_goW(rutte_p2_edgelist, rutte_p2_nodelist)
node_calc_Wdegree <- node_calc[with(node_calc, order("w_degree")),]

node_calc_Wdegree[1:10, c(2, 12)]
```
```
